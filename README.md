# PyLights
PyLights aims to make it easy to have your philips hue light bulbs pulse to whatever song or audio file you want.

Dependencies:

	-PyPhue (allows PyLights to communicate with philips hue lights)
	-Pickle (allows PyLights to save/load previously compiled song data to reduce loading time)
	-Librosa (allows PyLights to analyze audio and find onsets, rhythm, and beats)
